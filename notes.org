* Background


Picture collection of Press agency De Boer for the period 1945-2004. The picture
collection focuses on national and regional events, although over time the focus gradually
shifted to the region Kennemerland. This region just north of Amsterdam includes cities
such as Haarlem, Zandvoort, Bloemendaal, and Alkmaar.


In 1962, founder Cees de Boer was awarded the World Press Photo and the Silver Camera
(Zilveren Camera). Ceesâ€™ son Joppe won the national photojournalist award in 1969. The
press agency provided pictures to the Regional newspaper Haarlems Dagblad. The photo
collection depicted a wide range of events, ranging from the first and only show of The
Beatles in Blokker to opening of restaurants, and sport events.

The photo collection consists of approximately 2 million negatives and metadata. The
metadata is based on topic cards and logs kept by the photo agency. The inventory contains
data for the period 1945-1990. The agency detailed what was depicted using topic
cards. Moreover, for the period 1952-2004, De Boer kept logs. For the period 1952-1990,
these have been transcribed using volunteers, the remainder is in the process of
transcription with a deadline in juli 2018.  The negatives of the pictures are currently
being digitised, and these will be linked to the metadata using identifiers. These
pictures, however, are not segmented.

The metadata related to the pictures contains the following information. 
- *Unique identifier*
- *Topic*; transcribed from topic cards. Every sheet contains one topic.
- *Description*; a longer description.  
- *place*; information on the place depicted in the picture. 75,295 pictures have been
  linked to a 909 unique places.  
- *street*; information on the street depicted in the picture. 18,641 pictures have been
  linked to 3,368 unique streets.  
- *person*; information on the person depicted in the picture. 15,045 pictures have been
  linked to 8,574 unique people. There is some redundancy in this category.

* Datasets and categories

Microsofto Coco was trained on 100k images and includes 80 classes. 
ImageNet includes 13 million images and 22k classes, that are much more specific than
those in Coco. The categories in these two are combined using WordTree, because there
exists an hierarchical structure in these categorires. For example, specific types of dogs
are a subclass of the category 'dog'. This combinations leads to 9,418 classes
