  abstract = {Visual Cultural Heritage has extensively been explored using multimedia methods, but has so far been limited to still images. In particular, Early Cinema has hardly been explored. We analyze the Desmet collection, a recently digitized collection of early cinema (1907-1916), in the context of intertitles. Intertitles played an important role in silent movies in order to convey the main narratives, and split the film into semantically meaningful segments. We first build several classifiers to detect these intertitles, and evaluate it on a gold standard collection annotated by an expert. We illustrate the usefulness of using Deep Learning methods to extract semantic features to analyze the role of intertitles in early cinema. Furthermore, we attempt to structure and map the narrative progression of a film with respect to the locations at which shots were filmed.},

  abstract = {Built form dominates the urban space where most people live and work and provides a visual reflection of the local, regional and global esthetical, social, cultural, technological and economic factors and values. Street-view images and historical photo archives are therefore an invaluable source for sociological or historical study; however, they often lack metadata to start any comparative analysis. Date and location are two basic annotations often missing from historical images. Depending on the research question other annotations might be useful, that either could be visually derived (e.g. the number or age of cars, the fashion people wear, the amount of street decay) or extracted from other data sources (e.g. crime statistics for the neighborhood where the picture was taken). Recent advances in automatic visual analysis and the increasing amount of linked open data triggered the research described in this paper. We provide an overview of the current status of automated image analysis and linked data technology and present a case study and methodology to automatically enrich a large database of historical images of buildings in the city of Amsterdam.},

Properties of photographic items, such as position and orientation of the camera, can be automatically estimated using Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms to enable spatial queries on image repositories. Interactive spatial and temporal browsing of photographs of architecture and corresponding 3D models allows historians to gain knowledge about the development of a city, as well as about the changing interest of photographers in depicting particular buildings over time. In this chapter, we present a classification of phenomena modeling the statistical distribution of historical photographic depictions of architecture. This classification serves the design of specialized visualization methods that show statistical aggregation of photographs in spatial contexts, thus supporting research workflows of art and architectural historians.},

  abstract = {With the success of deep learning in the field of computer vision, object recognition has made important breakthroughs, and its recognition accuracy has been drastically improved. However, the performance of scene recognition is still not sufficient to some extent because of complex configurations. Over the past several years, scene recognition algorithms have undergone important evolution as a result of the development of machine learning and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN). This paper reviews many of the most popular and effective approaches to scene recognition, which is expected to create benefits for future research and practical applications. We seek to establish relationships among different algorithms and determine the critical components that lead to remarkable performance. Through the analysis of some representative schemes, motivation and insights are identified, which will help to facilitate the design of better recognition architectures. In addition, current available scene datasets and benchmarks are presented for evaluation and comparison. Finally, potential problems and promising directions are highlighted.},

  abstract = {An introduction to a broad range of topics in deep learning, covering mathematical and conceptual background, deep learning techniques used in industry, and research perspectives.``Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.''\rule{1em}{1pt}Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceXDeep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.},
